\chapter{Data Analysis}

\MyQuote{In physics, you don't have to go around making trouble for yourself - nature
does it for you.}{Frank Wilczek}

QCD jets are the most common hard objects observed at inelastic collisions 
at hadron colliders, with their cross section exceeding any other
physics process by orders of magnitude.  Measurement of inclusive jet cross
section provides the test for both QCD predictions and the detector
performance up to the momentum transfers not reachable by any other physics
processes. 

In this Chapter, I will describe the details of the double differential
inclusive jet cross section analysis, which I have done in this thesis.
I will begin with the characteristics of the Monte Carlo data, I have used.
These data together with the event selection criteria and matching procedure,
which description will follow, fully specify the input for the unfolding
procedure. Two approaches to the unfolding, which I have implemented in this
thesis, will be described and compared with each other. 

At the end of this Chapter, I will compare the results of my data analysis, with
the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD prediction of my supervisor. 

\section{Data Characteristics}

As the input, I have used Monte Carlo generated events of proton-proton collisions at
the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$ with \textsc{Pythia8}
\cite{Pythia8} event generator using CT10 Parton Distribution Functions
\cite{CT10PDF} and ATLAS Underlying Event Tune AU2 \cite{AU2}. QCD calculations
are done only to the leading order in \textsc{Pythia8}, so the initial hard
scattering is always simulated as $2\,\rightarrow\,2$ process. The response of
the ATLAS detector on these events was simulated with \textsc{Geant4}
\cite{Geant4} full detector simulation.

Particles were recombined into jets using anti-$k_t$ jet algorithm with
parameter $R=0.4$. There are particle jets, reconstructed from the
\textsc{Pythia8} output, which, further in this thesis, are denoted truth jets,
and, next to them, there are reco jets, reconstructed from the output of
\textsc{Geant4} detector simulation from the ATLAS detector topological cell
clusters. 

The events were generated in a slices according to the leading truth jet $\pt$. These
samples differ in an event weight, which is for the whole event calculated as 

\begin{equation}
  \text{weight} = \frac{\text{(XS)} \cdot \text{(FE)} \cdot w_0}{\text{(\# events)}},
\end{equation}
with XS beeing cross-section, FE filter efficiency and $w_0$ additional weight
factor stored in \texttt{EventInfoAux} container. Concrete values for datasets used in
this theses are given in Table~\ref{tab:JZXW}.  

\begin{table}

  \caption{The cross-sections (XS), filter efficiency (FE) and number of events
  for the JZXW samples, which differ in the leading truth jet $\pt$ range.}
  \label{tab:JZXW}
\end{table}

I have calibrated reco jets using the \textsc{ApplyJetCalibration}
\cite{ApplyJetCalibration} library v3.28 with configuration 
\texttt{JES\_Prerecommendation2015\_Feb2015.config} and
calibration sequence \texttt{JetArea\_Residual\_EtaJES}. In next, reco jets
denote the reco calibrated jets.

In the analysis, I am using jets with transverse momentum $\pt>15\GeV$ and
rapidity $|y|<4$. Analysis is done in double binning in $\pt$ and $|y|$, with
the edges being the same as those in the analysis from 2011/2012 \cite{Analysis2012},
which has chosen the binning in $\pt$ to uncertainty in each bin was
approximately one half of $\pt$ resolution for jets within the bin.

\begin{align}
  \pt = \, &15-20-25-35-45-55-70-85-100-116-134-152- \nonumber \\
        &172-194-216-240-264-290-318-346-376-408- \nonumber \\

  |y| = \, &0.0-0.5-1.0-1.5-2.0-2.5-3.0-3.5-4.0.
  \label{eq:Binning}
\end{align}

\section{Event Selection}

In this Section, I describe the selection and the matching criteria, I have used
in my analysis. The former is needed to cut those jets (or those events) off,
which were misinterpreted by the detector. By the later, the pairs, each
containing one reco and one truth jet, are created. This provide
the inputs for the unfolding procedure, which is the subject of the next
Section.

More details, including graphical display and numerical results for procedures
described in this Section, are given in Appendix~\ref{App:CutAndMatchingResults}.

\subsection{Jet Cuts}
\label{SubSec:JetCuts}

I have implemented four jet cuts, which description follows. First two of these
cuts are needed to remove jets, with $\pt$ or rapidity $y$ out of used binning.
The objective of the remaining cuts is to remove the events, which were badly
reconstructed by the detector.

\begin{itemize}
  \begin{samepage}
  \item \textbf{$\mathbf{\pt}$ Cut}
  \\*
    Reco and truth jets with $\pt > 15 \GeV$ were kept.
  \end{samepage}

  \item \textbf{$\mathbf{y}$ Cut}
  \\*
    Reco and truth jets with $|y| < 4$ were kept.

  \item \textbf{Zero jet (0-jet) Cut}
  \\*
    Only those events which has at least one reco and one truth jet are
    considered.
    
  \item \textbf{Leading Ration (LR) Cut}
  \\*
    In this cut the reco and truth jets with the highest $\pt$ were used. If
    there was only one reco jet left, the ratio $LR = p_{T,leading}^{reco} /
    p_{T,leading}^{truth}$ was calculated. If there were two reco jets, instead
    of $p_{T,leading}^{reco}$ the average $\pt$ of two leading reco jets was
    calculated. If $0.6 < LR < 1.4$ the event is considered.

\end{itemize}

Numbers of reco and truth jets, removed in each step, are shown in
Table~\ref{tab:CutAndMatchingEfficiency}, where also the cut efficiencies for
individual JZ samples are shown. The impact of each cut on jet $\pt$ spectrum
of reco and truth jets is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:Cutting}. 

It can be seen, that the most important cut is the 0-jet cut, which removes
approximately $80\,\%$ of reco jets in JZ0W sample, whereas the truth jets
remain intact. According to Table~\ref{tab:JZXW}, the leading truth jet $\pt <
20 \GeV$ for event from the JZ0W sample, which has no longer to hold for reco
jets, which were, in some cases, reconstructed with $\pt \sim 100 \GeV$. Because
of Monte Carlo event weight for events from JZ0W sample is dominant over event
weights of other JZ samples by several orders, the misreconstructed reco jets
from JZ0W sample were negatively influencing the observed $\pt$ spectrum of reco
jets, as can be seen from top of the Figure~\ref{fig:Cutting}.

\subsection{Jet Matching}
\label{SubSec:JetMatching}

To find, how the truth jets are reconstructed by the detector, the jet matching
has to be done, i.e. for each truth jet it is needed to find corresponding reco
jet. In this thesis, I have used the matching based on minimal angular distance
between matched jets, and its description follows in this Section. 

For each pair $(i,j)$ of reco and truth jets, the quantity $dR_{ij} =
\sqrt{d\phi_{ij}^2 + dy_{ij}^2}$ was calculated, with $d\phi_{ij}$ being the angle
between $\phi_i^{reco}$ and $\phi_j^{truth}$ and $dy_{ij} = y_i^{reco} -
y_j^{truth}$.  The minimum was found between all of $dR_{ij}$'s. If this was
smaller than the defined cutoff $\min(dR_{ij}) = dR_{pq} < dR^{cutoff} = 0.2$,
the jets $(p,q)$ were matched and further not assumed in the matching procedure.
This continued until condition $\min(dR_{ij}) < dR^{cutoff}$ was not satisfied
or all of the reco or truth jets were matched.

Numbers of reco and truth jets, both matched and unmatched, are shown in
Table~\ref{tab:CutAndMatchingEfficiency}, where also the matching efficiencies
for individual JZ samples are shown. Figure~\ref{fig:Matching} shows the $\pt$
spectra of truth and reco jets after event selection, which are composed from
$\pt$ spectra of matched and unmatched jets, which are in the
Figure~\ref{fig:Matching}  shown also.  $\pt$ spectra of truth and reco jets are
for all rapidity bins, assumed in this thesis, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:ptSpectraMasacreEverythingFuck}.

  \makebox[\textwidth][c]{

  }
  \caption{Comparison of $\pt$ spectra of reco and truth jets, after event
    selection, for selected $|y|<0.5$ rapidity bin. Each $\pt$ bin was divided by
    its width, so $y$-axis has physical meaning of double differential cross
    section in $\pt$ and $y$. Bottom graph contains the relative difference
    between reco and truth spectra.} 
  \label{fig:SignalVSTruth}
\end{figure}

\section{Unfolding}
\label{Sec:Unfolding3}

After the four cuts from the Section~\ref{SubSec:JetCuts}, the sets of jets,
denoted reco and truth jets, were obtained. Matching procedure, described in the
Section~\ref{SubSec:JetMatching},
divided both reco and truth jets into two categories, depending on successful
matching - there is correspondence 1 : 1 between matched reco and matched truth
jets. Reco jets, which were not matched, formed the unmatched reco jets, and,
similarly, a set of unmatched truth jets was created. All these 6 sets of jets
are needed by the unfolding procedure, which I describe in this Section.

From the Figure~\ref{fig:SignalVSTruth}, showing the $\pt$ spectra of reco and
truth jets, it can be seen, that observed $\pt$ spectrum, represented by the reco jets,
differs from the $\pt$ spectrum theoretically expected, which is represented by
the $\pt$ spectrum of truth jets. Unfolding should transform the observed $\pt$
spectrum to the spectrum theoretically expected. If this transformation would be
done on real data, it should, ideally, preserve additional structures, which are
presented in data, but not included by the theory.

The main ingredient for the unfolding procedure is the transfer matrix $A_{ij}$,
which contains the number of reco jets in bin $i$ with a matched truth jets,
which was generated in bin $j$, and describes thus the smearing effects of the
detector. In this thesis, I use the double binning \eqref{eq:Binning}, which
complicates the situation, because the matched reco jet can simply migrate of the
transfer matrix from Figure~\ref{fig:UnfoldingMatrixDetail}, when, for example,
its rapidity $|y|>0.5$ and when it was matched with a truth jet with $|y|<0.5$ or
vice versa. In this thesis, I test two unfolding approaches, which offer
the dealing with double binning.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Simple unfolding}
  \\*
    In this case, only those reco and truth jets are used in the transfer
    matrix, which were matched within the same rapidity bin. Remaining matched
    jets are added to the unmatched jets. Eight transfer matrices $46 \times
    46$ are filled (one for each rapidity bin, $46$ = number of $\pt$ bins) and
    unfolding is done for each of these matrices separately. One of these
    matrices, for $|y|<0.5$ rapidity bin, is shown in
    Figure~\ref{fig:UnfoldingMatrixDetail}.

  \item \textbf{2D unfolding}
  \\*
    In this case, the unfolding matrix is redefined, to encapsulate the matching
    of jets between different rapidity bins. In this case, only one transfer
    matrix $368 \times 368$ is created ($368 = 46 \times 8$), with unfolding being
    done only for this matrix, shown at Figure~\ref{fig:UnfoldingMatrixAll}, from which
    the way, how the transfer matrix was redefined from the simple unfolding
    approach, should follow. 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[p]
  \centering
  \makebox[\textwidth][c]{
    \includegraphics[width=1.2\textwidth]{{Chapter3/Unfold_matrix_firstBin}.eps}
  }
  \caption{Unfolding matrix for matched reco and truth jets with rapidity
  $|y|<0.5$, corresponding to one of eight transfer matrices used by the simple unfolding
  approach.  Each cell is proportional to the number of jets with truth $\pt$ in
  range determined by the $x$-axis, which were reconstructed to the reco jets
  with $\pt$ determined by the $y$-axis. White space signalize no input.}
  \label{fig:UnfoldingMatrixDetail}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[p]
  \centering
  \makebox[\textwidth][c]{
    \includegraphics[width=1.2\textwidth]{{Chapter3/Unfold_matrix_all}.eps}
  }
  \caption{Transfer matrix used by the 2D unfolding approach. Each cell is
    proportional to the number of jets with truth $\pt$ and rapidity $y$
    determined by the $x$-axis, which were reconstructed to the reco jets with
    $\pt$ and $y$ determined by the $y$-axis. Marked square in $|y|<0.5$ region
    is the matrix shown in Figure~\ref{fig:UnfoldingMatrixDetail}. Projection of
    this matrix on the $x$ and $y$-axis corresponds to the $\pt$ spectrum of
    matched truth and reco jets for corresponding rapidity bin respectively.
    For better understanding of structure of this matrix, I have created some
    slices, which are shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:UnfoldingMatrixSlices}.} 
  \label{fig:UnfoldingMatrixAll}
\end{figure}

Transfer matrix from Figure~\ref{fig:UnfoldingMatrixAll}, used by the 2D
unfolding approach, contains 8 submatrices at the diagonal, which are the transfer
matrices used by the simple unfolding approach. Next to these submatrices,
transfer matrix of 2D unfolding approach contains 14 additional submatrices
beside the diagonal. These correspond to the matched jets with migration in
rapidity bins, and in case of simple unfolding approach, these jets are assumed to be
unmatched.  To better understand the structure of transfer matrix of 2D
unfolding approach, I have created slices through it, which are shown in
Appendix~\ref{sec:UnfoldingMatrixSlices}.

It can be seen, from the slices, that the dominant elements of each of the
submatrices are on the main diagonal, which correspond to the fact, there is no
significant bias in $\pt$ reconstruction.
The finite $\pt$ resolution causes the smearing of the diagonal and a finite
rapidity resolution is the cause of the presence of 14 minor submatrices. 
Next, it can be seen, that the elements of the minor submatrices are
approximately two orders in magnitude smaller, than the corresponding submatrix
on the main diagonal. This means, that the migration of matched jets in rapidity
is much smaller, than the migration in $\pt$. 

Next to the transfer matrix, numbers of matched and unmatched reco and truth
jets are needed, for each $(y,\pt)$ bin, by unfolding procedure. These serve for
calculation of matching efficiencies, which are the key ingredient in the first and
in the last step of the unfolding procedure. Matching efficiencies, for $|y|<0.5$
rapidity bin, are for both simple and 2D unfolding shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:MatchingEfficiencyDemonstration} and for other rapidity bins,
they are shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:MatchingEfficiency}.

    are shown in Appendix \ref{sec:MatchingEfficiency}.}

    Appendices \ref{sec:UnfoldingResults}, \ref{sec:SimpleAnd2DUnfolding}. }
  \label{fig:UnfoldingResultsDemonstration}
\end{figure}


Unfolding procedure can be divided into three main steps

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Input data are multiplied by the matching efficiencies of reco jets.
  \item Transfer matrix is used to correct data spectrum for detector effects.
    For this purpose, the Iterative Dynamical Stabilized (IDS)
    \cite{IterativeDynamicallyStabilized} unfolding method was implemented,
    which uses the series of iterations to improve unfolding results. In this
    thesis, I have iterated once.
  \item The spectrum obtained by the step 2 is divided by the matching
    efficiencies of truth jets, in order to correct resulting spectrum for the
    unmatched truth jets.
\end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{fig:UnfoldingResultsDemonstration} shows the comparison of $\pt$
spectra of reco jets and unfolded spectrum (by 2D unfolding approach) with the
$\pt$ spectrum of truth jets on the left. The right part of the
Figure~\ref{fig:UnfoldingResultsDemonstration} contains the comparison of simple and 2D unfolded
spectra with the spectrum of truth jets for $|y|<0.5$ rapidity bin.
Results for all rapidity bins are shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:UnfoldingResults}.

From figures it follows, the unfolding procedure corrects the
$\pt$ spectrum of reco jets to $\pt$ spectrum of truth jets up to the systematic
error $<10^{-3}\,\%$ and that the differences between results from simple and 2D
unfolding approaches are even smaller.

\section{Comparison with NLO Prediction}
\label{sec:ComaprisonWithNLOPrediction}

In the previous Sections, I have described the jet calibration and the unfolding
procedure. These serve to remove the detector imperfections and correct the
$\pt$ spectrum of reco jets to the $\pt$ spectrum of truth jets. This was done using the
events generated by \textsc{Pythia8}, which uses
the leading order QCD calculations to simulate the initial proton-proton collision.
Nowadays the QCD predictions are tested up to next-to-leading order and for
LHC Run~II, new calculations, assuming next-to-next-to-leading order QCD
processes, are preparing \cite{NNLO1,NNLO2}.

My supervisor has determined the theoretical prediction of $\pt$ spectra of
parton jets using \textsc{NLOJET++} program v4.1.2 \cite{NLOJetProgram}. This
program computes the QCD processes up to next-to-leading order with CT10
parton distribution functions \cite{CT10PDF, Annecy}. In this thesis, I have used
his computations for center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}=8\TeV$ and
$\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$, the first corresponding to the LHC Run~I and the second to
the LHC Run~II. 

In this Section, I compare the truth jet $\pt$ spectrum from \textsc{Pythia8}
with the theoretical prediction of parton jet $\pt$ spectrum from
next-to-leading order QCD predictions of my supervisor.

Firstly, I have compared the next-to-leading order predictions for two different
center-of-mass energies of proton-proton collisions.
The comparison is shown, for $|y|<0.5$ rapidity region, in
Figure~\ref{fig:ComparePredictionsDemonstation}, where next to the double differential
cross section, the expected numbers of jets, observed in the LHC Run~I and II,
are shown. The numbers were obtained by multiplying each bin by its width and
by the luminosities of Run~I ($20\,\text{fb}^{-1}$) and expected luminosity for 
Run~II ($100\,\text{fb}^{-1}$) respectively. Comparisons for other rapidity bins
are shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:PredictionsForRunIAndII}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{{Chapter3/PredictionCompare0}.eps} 
  \caption{Comparison of next-to-leading order QCD predictions of double differential inclusive jet
    cross section (black) for proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$
    (filled circles),
    corresponding to the LHC Run~II, and $\sqrt{s}=8\TeV$ (empty circles),
    corresponding to the LHC Run~I. The cross section is multiplied by
    integrated luminosities and bin width in $\pt$, to obtain the expected
    numbers of jets observed in each $\pt$ bin (blue). Figure shows only $|y|<0.5$ rapidity bin,
    remaining rapidity bins are shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:PredictionsForRunIAndII}.}
  \label{fig:ComparePredictionsDemonstation}
\end{figure}

It can be seen, that the increase in the center-of-mass energy is the most
significant for jets with high $\pt$. 

In the next-to-leading theoretical computations, several uncertainties are taken
into account. In this thesis, I assume the following uncertainties 

\begin{figure}[p]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{{Chapter3/NLO_Systematics8_TeV0}.eps}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{{Chapter3/NLO_Systematics13_TeV0}.eps}
  \caption{Theoretical uncertainties for next-to-leading order QCD predictions
    of inclusive jet double differential cross section for proton-proton collisions at
    $\sqrt{s}=8\TeV$ (top) and $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ (bottom) for $|y|<0.5$ rapidity
    bin. Uncertainties for other rapidity bins are shown in
    Appendix~\ref{sec:NLOUncertainties}.}
    \label{fig:NLOSystematicsDemonstartion}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Scale uncertainty}
  \\*
    Coming from the choice of renormalization and factorization scales,
    including neglecting the higher order terms beyond next-to-leading order 

  \item \textbf{$\alpha_S$ uncertainty}
  \\*
    Because $\alpha_S$ is experimentally determined with uncertainty.

  \item \textbf{PDF uncertainty}
  \\*
    Prediction depends on the concrete choice of a Parton Distribution Function.
\end{itemize}

There are, at least, two other uncertainties, which should be assumed, but
according to the analysis from 2013 \cite{Analysis2012}, the corrections coming
from these uncertainties are not as significant as the three corrections
mentioned already.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Nonperturbative corrections uncertainty}
  \\*
    Hadronization and Underlying Event corrections

  \item \textbf{Electroweak corrections uncertainty}
  \\*
    Next to the QCD processes, the electroweak processes has to be assumed.
    These processes becomes more important, as the momentum transfer
    increases.  
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{{Chapter3/Truth_VS_Prediction0Compare}.eps}
  \caption{Comparison of \textsc{Pythia8} prediction with next-to-leading order QCD prediction of
    inclusive jet double differential cross section for $|y|<0.5$ rapidity bin,
    with uncertainties of next-to-leading order QCD predictions symbolized by the blue area.
    Comparisons for other rapidity bins are shown in Appendix
    \ref{sec:PythiaAndNLO}.}
  \label{fig:TruthVSPredictionsDemonstation}
\end{figure}

The corrections were extracted from the files with next-to-leading order QCD
predictions, where each correction is represented by the set of equally likely
histograms, expressing the deviation from the default prediction. Corrections
are, for $|y|<0.5$ rapidity bin, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:NLOSystematicsDemonstartion}, other rapidity bins are shown in
Appendix~\ref{sec:NLOUncertainties}.

Comparison of $\pt$ spectra of truth jets with next-to-leading order QCD
prediction is, for $|y| < 0.5$ rapidity bin, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:TruthVSPredictionsDemonstation}, for other rapidity bins see
Appendix~\ref{sec:PythiaAndNLO}. It can be seen, that the
truth $\pt$ spectrum is for jets with low $\pt$ greater, then the next-to-leading order QCD
prediction, and that for a few $\pt$ bins with the highest $\pt$, the situation is
reversed. 

Generally, there is a significant difference between leading order QCD
prediction, which I have extracted from the $\pt$ spectra of truth jets in
\textsc{Pythia8} generated events, and next-to-leading order QCD prediction,
which my supervisor has calculated using the \textsc{NLOJET++} program. The
differences are greater then the theoretical uncertainties, successfully
demonstrating the influence of next-to-leading order QCD processes, on
observables.
