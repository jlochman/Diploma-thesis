This thesis deals with the meassurement of the inclusive jet double differential
cross section in $\pt$ and rapidity using \textsc{Pythia8} generated events of
$pp$ colisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13 \, \text{TeV}$ with the ATLAS detector response
reconstructed by \textsc{Geant4} detector simulation. Differential cross
section obtained from the detector level is unfolded on the particle level
and compared with the parton level cross section prediction of the NLO pQCD.
Two different approaches of unfolding denoted as the simple and 2D unfolding are
used and results of these two approaches are compared. Both \textsc{Pythia8} and
NLO pQCD have used CT10 PDFs and ATLAS underlying event tune AU2.

\chapter*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

Search for the superior equation which would be able to explain all about the
physical universe we do observe, sometimes called the Theory of Everything, led
physicists to the concept of elementary particles some of which define the
building blocks of our observable universe whereas the remaining govern the way how
they interact. 

From the beginning of the 20$^{th}$ century, the term of elementary particles
was redefined with new generation of physicists as is illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:HistoryOfElPartPhysics}. The latest reform was caused by quarks and the
invention of Quantum Chromodynamics describing its strong interaction which is
next to the electromagnetic and weak interactions encapsulated by the present
theory of elementary particles called the Standard Model. 

\begin{figure}[t]

    \cite{LatticeQCDForPedestrians}.}
  \label{fig:HistoryOfElPartPhysics}
\end{figure}

Although Standard Model contains mechanism for assigning elementary particles
masses, gravity was not included in Standard Model up to date because the
present attempts of quantization gravity and description gravity as the
interaction mediated by the quanta of gravity, known as gravitons, led to the
unrenormalizable theories. There are others by the Standard Model unresolved
questions including the nature of the dark part of our universe and the origin
of the matter-antimatter asymmetry. 

We know, the Standard Model is not the ultimate Theory of Everything,
but it successfully stands against present results from particle accelerators.  Last
discoveries in particle physics occured on $\sim 100\GeV$ energy scale with top
quark discovery \cite{TopQuark1,TopQuark2} with mass $173.34 \pm 0.98 \GeV$ in
1995 at Tevatron and Higgs boson discovery \cite{HiggsDiscovery} with mass
$125.09 \pm 0.32 \GeV$ in 2012 at CERN and both were successfully predicted by
the Standard Model. If there is new physics beyond the Standard Model on $\sim
\TeV$ scale, the LHC Run II could be the first to discover it
\cite{PhysicsAtRun2LHC}. 

This thesis deals with the measurement of double differential inclusive jets 
cross section in $\pt$ and rapidity. Inclusive jets are the dominant objects
observed on hadron colliders dominating any other observable physics process in
orders of magnitude and covering wide range of momentum transfers, inclusive
jets may serve as the test for both ATLAS detector performance and may
be able to revel some discrepancy between Standard Model predictions and the
experiment as well.

First Chapter deals with the Quantum Chromodynamics and follows the historical
development including experiments which led to the removing proton from the list
of elementary particles and replacing it by the quarks. QCD will be formulated
as the quantum field theory and the phenomenon known as the running coupling
constant will be discussed. This will lead to the division of the QCD into
perturbative and non-perturbative regions.

In the second Chapter, the Large Hadron Collider will be encountered with
detailed description of its largest ATLAS detector. The basic features of QCD
introduced in the previous chapter will be used to define jets - objects we do
dominantly observe on hadron colliders. The jet reconstruction on ATLAS detector
including description of jet calibration and unfolding of observed spectra will
be presented in this chapter as well.

Third chapter describes the steps of analysis beginning with characteristics of
data used, including event selection and jet matching criteria. Two approaches
of unfolding are used to unfold $\pt$ spectra on detector level to truth level.
Results obtained from both approaches are compared with each other and with the
NLO pQCD prediction on parton level.

\chapter*{Conclusion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion}

This thesis deals with the measurement of the inclusive jet double differential
cross section in $\pt$ and rapidity. Inclusive jets are dominant objects created
by the ultrarelativistic collisions at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with $\pt$
covering range from a few $\GeV$ to a few $\TeV$. Nowhere is the increase in the
center-of-mass energy appreciated as is in the case of inclusive jets as it can
be seen from Figure \ref{fig:ComparePredictionsDemonstation}  According to the
preliminary analysis, the $pp$ collision in LHC Run II with the center-of-mass
energy $\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$ could create a thousands of jets with $1\TeV < \pt <
4\TeV$.

Inclusive jets are theoretically straightforward and hence powerful test of
perturbative Quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) and with wide range of 
momentum transfers, the inclusive jet cross section is sensitive to the
properties of the running coupling constant $\alpha_S$.  Momentum transfers in
orders of $\sim 1 \TeV$ will probe the structure of proton at small distance
scales $\lambda \sim 1 / \pt \sim \TeV^{-1} \sim 10^{-19} \, \text{m}$ and will
contribute to our understanding of the proton structure (parton distribution
functions (PDF)). If there is new physics at these scales (such as the
structure of quark), the inclusive jets may reveal it.

After an introduction, thesis begins with a brief description of the Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD) as one of the parts of the Standard Model (SM) following
its historical development during which description the key concepts of QCD are
introduced.  These include the PDFs, running coupling constant $\alpha_S$ and
asymptotic freedom phenomenons, leading to splitting QCD into perturbative and
non-perturbative regions. 

LHC with the ATLAS detector are described in the second chapter in which the key
concept of this thesis - the jet - is defined. This include the description of
jet algorithms with emphasize on anti-$k_t$ jet algorithm relevant for this
thesis and the procedure which must be done to detector recorded signal
could be compared with the theoretical predictions of QCD leading to inevitable
definitions of jet calibration and unfolding procedures. 

The last chapter describes the analysis of double differential inclusive jet
cross section in $\pt$ and rapidity. As the input data, the
\textsc{Pythia8} generated events of $pp$ collisions with center-of-mass energy
$\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ using CT10 PDFs and ATLAS underlying event tune AU2.
These data provided the detector and particle level jets, which were
reconstructed using anti-$k_t$ jet algorithm with $R=0.4$. Jet energy scale
calibration is done on detector level jets and $\pt$ spectrum obtained after
event selection is unfolded on particle level.

Two different approaches to unfolding were used - simple unfolding which matches
jets only within the same rapidity bin and 2D unfolding which allows the
migration of matched jets between different rapidity bins. These approaches
differ in definitions of transfer matrices and in matching efficiencies which
are shown in Appendix \ref{sec:MatchingEfficiency}. It can be seen the matching
efficiency in case of simple unfolding is $\sim 2-5\,\%$ worse than the matching
efficiency in 2D unfolding. This should cause the unfolded spectrum from simple
unfolding will be more precise than that of 2D unfolding.

The results from both of the unfolding approaches are compared with the $\pt$
spectrum of particle level jets in Appendix \ref{sec:SimpleAnd2DUnfolding}. It
can be seen, that in both cases, the unfolded $\pt$ spectrum is in agreement
with the $\pt$ spectrum of particle level jets up to systematic error $<
10^{-3}\,\%$ and that the relative difference between two unfolding approaches
is even smaller.

The second input for this analysis are the next-to-leading (NLO) order perturbative QCD
predictions of double differential inclusive jet cross section in $\pt$ and
rapidity for center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}=8\TeV$ (corresponding to LHC Run I)
and $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ (Run II) calculated using \textsc{NLOJET++} program using
the same parton distribution functions as \textsc{Pythia8}. In predictions the
uncertainties in coupling constant $\alpha_S$, PDFs and
factorization and normalization scales are included. These uncertainties are
shown in Appendix \ref{sec:NLOUncertainties}.

Cross section predictions for $\sqrt{s}=8\TeV$ and $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ are
compared in Appendix \ref{sec:PredictionsForRunIAndII} where with the usage of
integrated luminosities $L=20\,\text{fb}^{-1}$ (Run I) and
$L=100\,\text{fb}^{-1}$ (Run II expected) the numbers of jets expected to be
observed in each $\pt$ bin were calculated. It can be seen, that according to
this prediction, in Run II $\sim 1000$ times more jets with $\pt > 1\TeV$ will
be observed than it was in Run I. In addition LHC run II could create a few jets
with $\pt \sim 4 \TeV$.

$\pt$ spectrum of particle jets obtained from \textsc{Pythia8} is compared with
$\pt$ spectrum of parton jets from NLO prediction in Appendix
\ref{sec:PythiaAndNLO}. Only for few highest $\pt$ bins the cross section
predicted by the NLO is bigger than that of \textsc{Pythia8} whereas for low
$\pt$ the situation is opposite. The explanation for this behavior lies in
hadronization, by which the original parton jet with high $\pt$ can split into
two or more jets with smaller $\pt$'s.

There are several ways to extend this analysis. Although this analysis is only
preparation for the analysis of real data which will be collected in LHC Run II,
the implementations of the IDS unfolding method developed could serve for
unfolding of the real $\pt$ spectra measured by the ATLAS detector in Run II.
The unfolding results could be further improved by the running on new datasets
generated by the \textsc{Pythia8} with the usage of newer parton density
functions. The NLO prediction should be improved by the assuming the electroweak
and non-perturbative corrections.
