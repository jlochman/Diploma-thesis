This thesis deals with the measurement of the inclusive jet double differential
cross section in $\pt$ and rapidity in proton-proton colisions at
$\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ with the ATLAS detector. 
The measurement uses the Monte Carlo simulated data by the \textsc{Pythia8}
event generator and anti-$k_t$ jets with parameter $R=0.4$ reconstructed at
particle and detector level.
Differential cross section obtained from the detector level is unfolded to the
particle level and compared with the parton level differential cross section
prediction of the next-to-leading perturbative QCD.  
Two different approaches of unfolding denoted as the simple and 2D unfolding are
implemented and results of these two approaches are compared.
Both of these approaches can be applyed to unfold differential cross section of
inclusive jets measured by the ATLAS detector in LHC Run II, which will start in
early summer 2015.

\vspace{0.5cm} 
There are many people to whom I am indebted. First and the most important of
these is my supervisor, Ing. Zden\v{e}k Hub\'{a}\v{c}ek, Ph.D.. Two years ago,
he threw me into the unknown world of particle physics. With his help, I learned
not to be frightened from the unknown. He taught me, how to use knowledge, I have
obtained at the university, to shed some light into the darkness. With his help,
the beautiful world of particle physics has revealed to me.

I deeply appreciate a support from my Faculty, when I was sent after my
supervisor at CERN. The leading support, which allowed this to happen, came from
Prof. Ing. Igor Jex, DrSc., to whom I would like to thank. It was astounding
feeling to be part of one of the leading experiments in particle physics and the
satisfaction, when I found out, I can make some contribution to it -
indescribable. 

Next thanks to my family for their support during my studies.

And thanks to You, Flying Spaghetti Monster, for creating such a beautiful
Universe, in which the physics reality extends far beyond the frontiers of human
imagination, that it is never going to let us relax.

\chapter*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

Search for the superior equation which coule explain all the physical universe
we observe, sometimes called the Theory of Everything, led some of the
physicists to the concept of elementary particles, some of which define the
building blocks of our observable universe, whereas the remaining govern their
interaction.

From the beginning of the twentieth century, the term elementary particle
was redefined by a new generation of physicists, as illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:HistoryOfElPartPhysics}. The latest reform was caused by quarks
and the invention of Quantum Chromodynamics, describing its strong interaction
,which, apart from the electromagnetic and weak interaction, is encapsulated
by the present theory of elementary particles called the Standard Model. 

\begin{figure}[t]

  \caption[History of elementary particle physics.]{History of elementary
    particle physics. Figure taken from~\cite{LatticeQCDForPedestrians}.}
  \label{fig:HistoryOfElPartPhysics}
\end{figure}

Although the Standard Model contains mechanism for assigning masses to
elementary particles, gravity was not included in it up
to date, because the current attempts to quantize and describe gravitation as an
interaction mediated by the quanta of gravity, know as gravitons, led to
unrenormalizable theories. There are other questions, unresolved by the Standard
Model, such as the nature of the dark part of our Universe or the origin of the
matter-antimatter asymmetry.

We know that the Standard Model is not the ultimate Theory of Everything,
but it successfully stands against present results from particle physics
experiments. 
Last discoveries of elementary particles, successfully predicted by the Standard
Model, occurred on $\sim 100\GeV$ energy scale with top quark discovery
\cite{TopQuark1,TopQuark2} with mass $173.34 \pm 0.98 \GeV$ in 1995 at Tevatron
and Higgs boson discovery \cite{HiggsDiscovery} with mass $125.09 \pm 0.32 \GeV$
in 2012 at CERN.
If there is a new physics beyond the Standard Model on $\sim \TeV$ scale, the
LHC Run II could be the first to discover it \cite{PhysicsAtRun2LHC}. 

This thesis deals with the measurement of the double differential inclusive jet 
cross section in $\pt$ and rapidity. 
The term inclusive stresses the fact, we are not interested in other particles,
which can be, next to the jets, created by the collision.
Jets are the dominant objects observed at inelastic collisions on hadron
colliders and, covering a wide range of momentum transfers, they overshadow any
other observable physics process in orders of magnitude.
Inclusive jets measurements may therefore verify the ATLAS detector performance,
as well as reveal some discrepancy in the Standard Model predictions.

First Chapter of this thesis discuss the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and
follows its historical development, including the experiments which led to the
removal of the proton from the list of elementary particles, replacing it with
the quarks. 
I will formulate the QCD as a quantum field theory and I will discuss the phenomenon
known as a running coupling constant, so that the QCD can be divided into
perturbative and non-perturbative regions.

The second Chapter concerns with the Large Hadron Collider along a detailed
description of the ATLAS detector. 
I will use the basic features of the QCD, introduced in the previous Chapter, to
define jets - objects predominantly observed at inelastic collisions on hadron
colliders. At the end of this Chapter, I will also present the jet
reconstruction on ATLAS detector, including description of jet calibration and
unfolding of observed spectra.

Third chapter describes the steps of the inclusive jet analysis, beginning with
the characteristics of Monte Carlo data used, including event selection 
criteria. I use two approaches to unfold $\pt$ spectra from
detector level to particle level. In the end I compare results obtained from
both approaches and set them against the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD
prediction of parton level.

\chapter*{Conclusion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion}

This thesis deals with the measurement of the inclusive jet double differential
cross section in $\pt$ and rapidity in the ATLAS experiment. Inclusive jets are
the prevailing objects created in the inelastic collisions at the LHC with $\pt$
covering range from a few $\GeV$ to a few $\TeV$. Nowhere is the increase in the
center-of-mass energy appreciated as is in the case of inclusive jets as it can
be seen from Figure~\ref{fig:ComparePredictionsDemonstation}. According to the
preliminary analysis, the $pp$ collision in LHC Run II with the center-of-mass
energy $\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$ could create thousands of jets with $\pt$ in the
intrrval $1\TeV < \pt < 4\TeV$.

Inclusive jets are theoretically straightforward and hence powerful test of
perturbative QCD and with wide range of 
momentum transfers, the inclusive jet cross section is sensitive to the
properties of the running coupling constant $\alpha_S$.  Momentum transfers in
orders of $\sim 1 \TeV$ will probe the structure of proton at small distance
scales $\lambda \sim 1 / \pt \sim \TeV^{-1} \sim 10^{-19} \, \text{m}$ and will
contribute to our understanding of the proton structure (parton distribution
functions). If there is new physics at these scales (such as the
structure of quark), the inclusive jets may reveal it.

This thesis begins with a brief description of QCD as one of the components of
the Standard Model. My intention was to connect historical development of QCD
with definitions of its key concepts, which I am using later in this thesis.
These concepts include the parton distribution functions, running coupling
constant $\alpha_S$ and asymptotic freedom phenomena. The first chapter ends
with the splitting of QCD into perturbative and non-perturbative regions.

The second chapter starts with the description of the LHC with the ATLAS
detector, and introduces the most important concept of this thesis - a jet. Using
the QCD, I am trying to explain the necessity of the jet on hadron colliders,
and to define the jet itself. This is done by the definition of jet algorithms,
which I am formulating with the emphasis on possible jet definition at three
different stages of collision: at parton, particle and detector level. The
second chapter ends with the description of jet energy scale calibration and
unfolding procedures, which objective is to reduce negative detector effects and
to lower differences between jets at detector and particle levels. 

The last chapter of my thesis describes the analysis of the double differential
inclusive jet cross section in $\pt$ and rapidity $y$. As the Run II data are
not yet available, I have used as the input the \textsc{Pythia8} generated
events of $pp$ collisions with the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ using
CT10 parton distribution functions and ATLAS underlying event tune AU2. These
data contains the jets reconstructed on particle and detector levels and as a
jet algorithm, the anti-$k_t$ jet algorithm with parameter $R=0.4$ is used.

The first step of my analysis is energy scale calibration of jets on detector
level, which is followed by the description of event selection criteria and jet
matching procedure. To correct the reconstructed $\pt$ spectrum on detector
level, I implement two different approaches of data unfolding. A simple
unfolding, the first of unfolding approaches, allows jet matching only within
the same rapidity bins. In addition to the simple unfolding I introduce a 2D
unfolding, which allows matching between different rapidity bins. These
approaches differ in definitions of transfer matrices and in matching
efficiencies which are shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:MatchingEfficiency}.
It can be seen the matching efficiency in case of simple unfolding is $\sim
2-5\,\%$ worse than the matching efficiency in 2D unfolding. This should cause
the unfolded spectrum from 2D unfolding will be more precise than that of simple
unfolding.

The results from both of the unfolding approaches are compared with the $\pt$
spectrum of particle level jets in Appendix \ref{sec:SimpleAnd2DUnfolding}. It
can be seen, that in both cases, the unfolded $\pt$ spectrum is in agreement
with the $\pt$ spectrum of particle level jets up to systematic error $<
10^{-3}\,\%$ and that the relative difference between two unfolding approaches
is even smaller.

The second input for this analysis is the next-to-leading (NLO) order perturbative QCD
prediction of double differential inclusive jet cross section in $\pt$ and
rapidity for center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}=8\TeV$ (corresponding to LHC Run I)
and $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ (Run II) calculated using \textsc{NLOJET++} program using
the same parton distribution functions as \textsc{Pythia8}. The predictions
include uncertainties in coupling constant $\alpha_S$, PDFs and
factorization and normalization scales. These uncertainties are
shown in Appendix \ref{sec:NLOUncertainties}.

Cross section predictions for $\sqrt{s}=8\TeV$ and $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ are
compared in Appendix \ref{sec:PredictionsForRunIAndII} where the
integrated luminosities $L=20\,\text{fb}^{-1}$ (Run I) and
$L=100\,\text{fb}^{-1}$ (Run II expected) are used. The numbers of jets expected to be
observed in each $\pt$ bin were calculated. It can be seen, that according to
this prediction, in Run II $\sim 1000$ times more jets with $\pt > 1\TeV$ will
be observed than it was in Run I. In addition LHC run II could create a few jets
with $\pt \sim 4 \TeV$.

The $\pt$ spectrum of particle jets obtained from \textsc{Pythia8} is compared with
$\pt$ spectrum of parton jets from NLO prediction in Appendix
\ref{sec:PythiaAndNLO}. Only for few highest $\pt$ bins the cross section
predicted by the NLO is bigger than that of \textsc{Pythia8} whereas for low
$\pt$ the situation is opposite. The explanation is, that \textsc{Pythia8}
generates events of $pp$ collisions only using LO QCD.

There are several ways to extend this analysis. Although this analysis is only
preparation for the analysis of real data which will be collected in LHC Run II,
the implementations of the IDS unfolding method developed could serve for
unfolding of the real $\pt$ spectra measured by the ATLAS detector in Run II.
The unfolding results could be further improved by the running on new datasets
generated by the \textsc{Pythia8} with the usage of newer parton density
functions. 

The unfolding approaches introduced in this thesis could be probed further. One
of the possibility is the event reweighting and checking, if the unfolding is
not dependent on the shape of the $\pt$ spectra. Next possibility is to compare,
how the simple and 2D unfolding will deal with new structure in data.
