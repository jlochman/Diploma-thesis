This thesis deals with the meassurement of the inclusive jet double differential
cross section in $\pt$ and rapidity using \textsc{Pythia8} generated events of
$pp$ colisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13 \, \text{TeV}$ with the ATLAS detector response
reconstructed by \textsc{Geant4} detector simulation. Differential cross
section obtained from the detector level is unfolded on the particle level
and compared with the parton level cross section prediction of the NLO pQCD.
Both \textsc{Pythia8} and NLO pQCD have used CT10 PDFs and ATLAS underlying
event tune AU2.

\chapter*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

Search for the superior equation which would be able to explain all about the
physical universe we do observe, sometimes called the Theory of Everything, led
physicists to the concept of elementary particles some of which define the
building blocks of our observable universe whereas the remaining govern the way how
they interact. 

From the beginning of the 20$^{th}$ century, the term of elementary particles
was redefined with new generation of physicists as is illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:HistoryOfElPartPhysics}. The latest reform was caused by quarks and the
invention of Quantum Chromodynamics describing its strong interaction which is
next to the electromagnetic and weak interactions encapsulated by the present
theory of elementary particles called the Standard Model. 

\begin{figure}[t]

    \cite{LatticeQCDForPedestrians}.}
  \label{fig:HistoryOfElPartPhysics}
\end{figure}

Although Standard Model contains mechanism for assigning elementary particles
masses, gravity was not included in Standard Model up to date because the
present attempts of quantization gravity and description gravity as the
interaction mediated by the quanta of gravity, known as gravitons, led to the
unrenormalizable theories. There are others by the Standard Model unresolved
questions including the nature of the dark part of our universe and the origin
of the matter-antimatter asymmetry. 


%Humans have build large particle accelerators to verify, if the Standard Model
%is the correct theory of particle physics. Next to these experiments, the huge
%telescopes on the Earth as well as in the orbit are looking to the distant
%galaxies.  Although Standard Model have with the help of supercomputers
%succeeded in explanation of the structure and origin of recently observed
%objects (pulsars, neutron stars) and the description of Supernovas, the new
%yet unexplained phenomenons emerged including dark matter and dark energy.

%Standard Model in its present form is not able to explain what these dark
%substances of our universe are. Fortunately there are some theories or better -
%some extensions of Standard Model - which could have answer. These include the
%Supersymmetry or the theories of Extra Dimensions. 

Although it is sure, the Standard Model is not the ultimate Theory of
Everything, it successfully stands against present results from particle
accelerators. 
Last discoveries in particle physics occured on $\sim 100\GeV$ energy
scale with top quark discovery (?citace?) with mass $173.34 \pm 0.98 \GeV$ in 1995
at Tevatron and Higgs boson discovery (?citace?) with mass $125.09 \pm 0.32
\GeV$ in 2012 at CERN and both were successfully predicted by the Standard
Model. If there is new physics beyond the Standard Model on $\sim \TeV$ scale,
the LHC Run II could be the first to discover it \cite{PhysicsAtRun2LHC}. 

This thesis deals with the measurement of double differential inclusive jets 
cross section in $\pt$ and rapidity.  Inclusive jets are the dominant objects
observed on hadron colliders dominating any other observable physics process in
orders of magnitude and could thus be the one of the first indicators of new
physics. 

First Chapter deals with the Quantum Chromodynamics and follows the historical
development including experiments which led to the removing proton from the list
of elementary particles and replacing it by the quarks. QCD will be formulated
as the quantum field theory and the phenomenon known as the running coupling
constant will be discussed. This will lead to the division of the QCD into
perturbative and non-perturbative regions.

In the second Chapter, the Large Hadron Collider will be encountered with
detailed description of its largest ATLAS detector. The basic features of QCD
introduced in the previous chapter will be used to define jets - objects we do
dominantly observe on hadron colliders. The jet reconstruction on ATLAS detector
including description of jet calibration and unfolding of observed spectra will
be presented in this chapter as well.

Third chapter describes the steps of analysis.

\chapter*{Conclusion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion}

This thesis deals with the measurement of the inclusive jet double differential
cross section in $\pt$ and rapidity. Inclusive jets are dominant objects created
by the ultrarelativistic collisions at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with $\pt$
covering range from a few $\GeV$ to a few $\TeV$. Nowhere is the increase in the
center-of-mass energy appreciated as is in the case of inclusive jets as it can
be seen from figure ?.  According to the preliminary analysis, the $pp$
collision in LHC Run II with the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$ could
create a thousands of jets with $1\TeV < \pt < 4\TeV$.

Inclusive jets are theoretically straightforward and hence powerful test of
perturbative Quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) and with wide range of 
momentum transfers, the inclusive jet cross section is sensitive to the
properties of the running coupling constant $\alpha_S$.  Momentum transfers in
orders of $\sim 1 \TeV$ will probe the structure of proton at small distance
scales $\lambda \sim 1 / \pt \sim \TeV^{-1} \sim 10^{-19} \, \text{m}$ and will
contribute to our understanding of the proton structure (parton distribution
functions (PDF)). If there is new physics at these scales (such as the
structure of quark), the inclusive jets may reveal it.

After an introduction, thesis begins with a brief description of the Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD) as one of the parts of the Standard Model (SM) following
its historical development during which description the key concepts of QCD are
introduced.  These include the PDFs, running coupling constant $\alpha_S$ and
asymptotic freedom phenomenons, leading to splitting QCD into perturbative and
non-perturbative regions. 

LHC with the ATLAS detector are described in the second chapter in which the key
concept of this thesis - the jet - is defined. This include the description of
jet algorithms with emphasize on anti-$k_t$ jet algorithm relevant for this
thesis and the procedure which must be done to detector recorded signal
could be compared with the theoretical predictions of QCD leading to inevitable
definitions of jet calibration and unfolding procedures. 

Last chapter describes the analysis done in this thesis.
